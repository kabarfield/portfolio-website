	<h1> About Me: Ali Barfield </h1>
<p> Hello! I'm so glad you wanted to get to know a little bit more about me! My name is Alexandra but you can call me Ali. I've gone by many different nicknames so this may change but for now, I like it! 

I'm so glad that you've decided to stop by and get to know me. I've wanted to make a blog for years now and have never built up the courage to do one. That may sound silly, who needs courage to start a blog? Well I did! Now that I've finally done it I am so excited to get posting. As for now, I'm not going to set a schedule for posts. I'll just post as interesting things happen or as I have something to tell you guys! 

Now here's 5 facts about me, in case you're curious! 
1. I am in a relationship with the most incredible person that I get to call my best friend and partner, Aven.
2. I two kitties here in my tiny NYC apartment and I'm sure they'll be featured plenty.
3. I'm an introvert but I have an extroverted personality. This means that I would always choose to stay in but when I go out, I go all out and introduce myself and love to make new friends and socialize!
4. I tend to be a sensitive person and take on a lot of my friends emotions, usually when they're upset. 
5. I'm always early. I go by the motto, if you're not 15 minutes early then you're late! 

Even though this is my about me page, I'd like to get to know you too. Feel free to comment a few things about you that people may not know! 

Thanks for reading!
